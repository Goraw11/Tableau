# Final-Project-Tableau
Use Tableau to answer the following questions and deliver results using a 5-minute PowerPoint or PDF presentation. All questions should be answered using the right visualizations:

Show the trend of house prices across Canada in the last 40 years (table housing_price_index).
Compare the trend after 2005 with actual benchmark prices in table real_estate_prices to see if there are any differences.
Compare this trend with the trend of office prices. Which one is getting more expensive, faster?
Create a heatmap of Canada with current house prices for each available district.
Are the price differences between different districts increasing?
Compare the trend of house prices with earnings. *In case you want to plot monthly salary, be aware that the earnings value is per week.
Did people spend more of their earnings in 2014 than they did in 2001?
There were several economic crises in the world in the last 40 years, including these four: Black Monday (1987), Recession (early 1990s), dot com bubble (2000 - 2002), Financial crisis (2007 - 2009). Show the effect of these crises on:
Earnings
House prices
Office prices
House constructions
Consumer index
Plot consumer_index together with housing_price_index and fit the regression line between them. Can we predict consumer_index from the housing_price_index?
## Project/Goals
I used this project as an opportunity to consolidate my Tableau learnings. 

## Process
I uploaded the tables on to Tableau.
I then created the various joins and connections, as required.

## Results
(Fill in which Option you chose, either 1 or 2. List the dataset you selected for the project if you selected Option 2. Also, discuss the visualizations you created, and why. For Option 2, also identify what your data question was, and how you went through the prompts.)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
