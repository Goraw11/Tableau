# Final-Project-Tableau
For my final Tableau project, I decided to go with the FAA Dataset (Option 2).
In summary, the FAA Dataset describes and tabulates the unfortunate collisions between wildlife (mostly birds) with aircraft (mostly airplanes).

## Project/Goals
I used this project as an opportunity to consolidate my Tableau learnings.
I did this by "Asking questions to the data" - to find insights, and further validate my understanding.
My goal was to create an impactful summary, about how much damage happens, to both, the species impacted, as well as to the aircraft. I came across some eye-opening findings, which I will summarize below, and, I have summarized in my presentation as well.

## Process
I uploaded the FAA dataset on Tableau (Drag and drop).
I then created the various joins and connections, as required.
After this, I reviewed the dataset, went thru the data, the various columns, data types, etc.
After this, I started configuring some questions, which I felt would be a good exploration of the data.
(Detailed below in step # 2).

### (your step 2)

## Results
Here are some of the questions I tried to answer using visualizations.
Question 1: Which species are the most struck by airplanes?
I wanted to figure out what types of species are the most common victims in these unfortunate events.

Question 2: Which species costs the most damage to the aircraft?
I wanted to see which species create the most damage to the aircraft, and, also to see if they were birds or animals on land.

Question 3: When do most collisions happen?
I wanted what is the time day when most of the collisions happen.

Question 4: Where do most collisions happen?
Using spatial visualization, I wanted to see which geographies are prone to most accidents.

Question 5: What type of aircraft do most collision happen with?
I wanted to see if most accidents happen with a airplane or with helicopters.

Lastly, I wanted to present a nice dashboard to summarize my findings.

## Challenges 
I had some challenges with the spatial visualization, namely, overlaying datapoints on to geographical containers (maps). I plan to overcome this challenge by spending more time on this type of visualization.

## Future Goals
I would spend more time on these items below:
- Spatial visualizations.
- Making my dashboard more interactive.
- Making my dashboard more colorful.
